🙋‍♂️ About me

Just a guy from Portugal, trying to level up in IT - One script and one mistake at a time.

I'm currently working in IT Support, aiming to dive deeper into cybersecurity and programming.

Huuuge fan of coffee, command lines and FC Porto 💙🤍

This repository is my learning playground for random experiments, broken code, and some progress along the way!
